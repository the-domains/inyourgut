Every day is a challenge.

Temptations are everywhere.

It's hard to keep going.

You want to make healthy choices, but not sure how to start. Yep, I get it.

#### **3 KEYS TO SUSTAINING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE.**

1. **Implement your plan.** First, you need to have a plan! The plan should clearly state your goals and timelines for achievements. **An example could be --****_Week One_**: _Give up soda and sugary drinks._implement It's concrete. It's measurable. It's an achievable milestone that you can build on the following week. Like in business & relationships, simply having a diet plan doesn't mean anything unless you actually implement it every day. Some people dive feet first with an overhaul of lifestyle changes and some take an incremental approach -- choose what works best for you and create a plan that sets you up for success.
2. **Have patience.** Everyone wants instant gratification and if results don't happen overnight, we give up. We consider it a failed attempt. It takes commitment, patience and effort to achieve results. It took me 2 years to lower my crazy high triglycerides and cholesterol but I didn't give up. I kept tweaking my plan over the months but most importantly, I didn't throw in the towel after the first, 3rd or 14th month. I kept going. For years, you've made poor eating decisions that's led to undesirable health and those are tough behaviors to change. Real tough. On average, it takes about 30 days to change a habit so when you consistently make a healthier choice, it'll become the new habit without you even realizing it. Your plan is your road map to the destination but sometimes the journey can be long and windy, but eventually, you'll arrive so have some patience.
3. **Be committed.** Commitment is defined as, "_the state or quality of being dedicated to a cause, activity, etc._" Every meal, every snack, every drink choice you have is an opportunity for you to remain dedicated to your health plan. Those are chances to be successful on your plan. If your plan says that donuts are excluded from your diet, as hard as it is, be committed and walk away from it. Instead of feeling regret about eating the donut, walk away and feel proud you were able to leave it sitting there. That's success! Don't worry about the next meal, the next decision, the next day...just win that very moment! Your commitment level really drives your success (or failure) in achieving a desired weight, improving your biometrics, reduce your risk of chronic disease or all the above.

#### **TOOLS TO USE TO STAY ON TRACK.**

* [Buy a journal][0] to document your health plan, track milestones and achievements. Put your plan on paper!
* Use [Google Keep][1] (it's free!) to setup timely reminders, grocery lists, your weekly plan, to do list, etc. If you're on Android, [grab the app here][2] or for [iOS here][3].
* Use good ole "[sticky notes][4]" and post to your bathroom mirror, office monitor, in your car for subtle reminders
* Use Outlook for daily reminders, motivational sayings, tips, weekly plan reminder
* SnapChat me ([food.nerd][5]), send me a tweet ([@ScottInFL][6]) or email me below if you have questions, need advice or support -- it's free!

Look, there's no magic pill. There's no instant gratification. But if you really want to change your health, you need to realize that it's going to require 100% effort and patience to get on the right track. It's hard work. There's no shortcuts. You'll make tough decisions every day. When you notice your clothes fit a little looser, when your Doctor shows you improved blood work from the last visit or he/she takes you off medication, that's when it'll hit home that your health plan is working.

Don't give up now...keep going!
