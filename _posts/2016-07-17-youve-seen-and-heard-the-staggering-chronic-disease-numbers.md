You've seen and heard the staggering chronic disease numbers before but let's review them in case you haven't (and to emphasize the problem if you have seen them).

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010 FastStats:

* 36% of adults are obese
* Another 33.3% are overweight
* And 17% of our youth are obese

If the trend continues, 43.5% of adults in the US will be considered obese by 2019\.

That's staggering.

Based on 2010 CDC data, leading causes of death were:

* 796,960 deaths due to heart disease, stroke & diabetes
* 567,628 deaths due to cancer

The next closest cause of death was chronic lower respiratory disease at 137,353 deaths.

Mind-blowing statistics.

Ironically, everything I listed above is preventable unless you have a rare condition that contributes to a chronic disease.

In addition, 61%+ of Americans take at least 1 medication daily to treat a chronic disease AND 25%+ of Seniors pop 5 or more pills every day!

We need to wake up. Is that_REALLY_the quality of life you want to live? According to those stats, it's clear that health and obesity are in dire straits but there is hope and it doesn't come in a pill shape or the next "lose weight quick diet" fad. It's simply what you eat and staying active.

My goal isn't to live to be 150 yrs old (although that'd be awesome), but to have a quality life free of pharmaceuticals, no daily insulin shots and to significantly reduce my chances of having one of the deadly chronic diseases. Close your eyes and envision how you'd love to see your life at 80, 90 years old. What's preventing you from that being reality? YOU -- you're either the roadblock or the solution. How you treat your body directly contributes to the life you either enjoy in your retirement years or dread when it comes.

What's your goal? And more importantly, what are you doing to support those goals?
